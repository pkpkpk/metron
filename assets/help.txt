  --describe-instance  Return full result of AWS SDK DescribeInstanceCommand
  --status             Get relevant details of instance including running state
  --start              Starts instance, returns when ready

                       Pipes stderr & stdout from container result

Webhook Actions:
  --create-webhook      Create webhook stack
  --delete-webhook      Delete webhook stack

user interaction

Non-zero exits never return anything to stdout. The last line of stderr refers
to a temp file with debug information
